# Improving Call Graphs with Runtime Information

This repository contains the code and data used for our research on improving call graphs by incorporating runtime information. 
Our work focuses on improving static analysis tools to generate more *sound* call graphs.

Repository Structure

	•	flowdroid_runs/: Contains the output files generated by FlowDroid after running the analysis to obtain call graphs.
	•	modified_flowdroid/: Contains the source code of the modified version of FlowDroid that incorporates runtime information.
	•	generate_csv.py: A Python script that processes FlowDroid results to generate a CSV file summarizing the call graphs.
	•	compute_statistics.py: A Python script that computes statistical data based on the generated CSV file.
	•	random_2024_androzoo.lst: A list file representing the dataset used in our experiments.
